# Development guide for AIs

## Ask the developer for the ticket infos

Ask for these one after the other and give the developer a single input
field per answer — one question per field, never all of them in one
question and never as a plain prose question:

- Ask for the ticket ID
- Ask for the ticket title
- Ask for the ticket description

## Replace in this document

- Replace `~/dev/` by the workspace directory from the memory
- Ask for the workspace directory if none is known
- Replace `gGS-145` by the ticket ID you asked for
- Replace `Fix issue abc` by the ticket title you asked for

## Create a ticket

```bash
cd ~/dev/ # workspace
gg do create ticket gGS-145 -m"Fix issue abc"
cd tickets/gGS-145
```

## Choose the project management repo — or work without one

A ticket may belong to a project management repo. It holds the plans,
decisions and blog posts of a project, but no code. It is optional: ask the
user whether this ticket uses one. Write "project management repo" whenever
you write to the user, never "PM repo".

With a project management repo: look at the `index.jsonc` of each repo in
.ocean and find the one the ticket belongs to — its summary or domain talks
about project management or planning, not about code. If one fits, propose
it to the user. If none fits, ask the user which repo to use, or whether to
create a new one.

After the user's confirmation, add it to the ticket **before** any other
repo:

```bash
gg do add pm_repo
```

If it has `doc/guides/pm-repo-guide.md`, read it: it describes how the repo
is structured and how planning works there. If the file does not exist,
follow the guides that repo has.

Without a project management repo: skip this step and continue with the git
repositories. The ticket then carries no plan of its own.

## Add git repositories

Ask the user how the repos are chosen, as a single question with two
options: automatically or manually.

Manually: ask in a second single input field which repos the ticket needs,
e.g. `repo1 repo2`. Check each name against the repos in .ocean and ask
again for names that do not exist there. The entered list is the
confirmation; add the repos as shown below.

Automatically: look at the `index.jsonc` of each repo in .ocean and decide
which repos need to be added to the ticket.
Make a plan for how you roughly want to implement the ticket.
If certain parts of the implementation belong to a domain that does not yet
exist in the .ocean folder, consider creating a new repository.
Ask the user about this. Also explain to the user what you roughly want to
change in which repo to implement the ticket and let them confirm that the
corresponding repos are added to the ticket.

If the ticket is only planned (see below), the project management repo may
be the only repo of the ticket.

After the user's confirmation, add the repos to the ticket:

```bash
gg do add repo1 repo2
```

## Open the workspace in Vscode

```bash
gg do code
```

## Plan (optional)

Ask the user whether the ticket is planned before it is implemented.

If yes, write the plan into the project management repo, following its
`doc/guides/pm-repo-guide.md` if present, otherwise its other guides: the
goal, the affected repos, the rough steps and open questions. Without a
project management repo, put the plan into the ticket itself. Let the user
review the plan and revise it until they confirm it.

## Implement (optional)

Ask the user whether the ticket is implemented now, or whether it is only
planned. Some tickets are only planned; the implementation follows in a later
ticket.

- Implement: implement your features based on the guides
- Plan only: skip this step. The following steps then apply to the project
  management repo only.

## Keep the publish config up to date

Each repo of the ticket has a file `.gg/publish_config.json`. gg offers its
values as defaults: `gg do commit` pre-fills the commit message editor with
`nextCommitMessage`, `gg do publish` pre-selects `versionIncrement` and
pre-fills the merge message with `mergeMessage`. git ignores the file.

Whenever you change code in a repo, update `nextCommitMessage` of that repo
so it describes everything that is not committed yet, not only your last
step. Create the file if it does not exist. Change only the keys you mean
to change and keep the rest — `commits` is written by gg, never by hand.

```json
{
  "publishConfig": {
    "nextCommitMessage": {
      "firstLine": "Let the user pick the ticket repos",
      "details": ["Ask whether repos are chosen automatically or manually"]
    },
    "mergeMessage": "Let the user pick the ticket repos manually",
    "versionIncrement": "minor"
  }
}
```

- `firstLine`: imperative, at most 60 characters
- `details`: optional, one entry per line
- `mergeMessage`: the pull request title and the merge commit message of
  the repo
- `versionIncrement`: `patch`, `minor` or `major`, matching what the
  ticket changes in the repo

Set `mergeMessage` and `versionIncrement` as soon as the change of the repo
is clear, and adjust them when it changes. Only `gg do commit` in the
ticket folder reads `nextCommitMessage`; `gg one do commit` does not.

## Commit

```bash
gg do commit
```

`gg do commit` and `gg can commit` act on all repos of the ticket. When you
are inside a single repo instead of the ticket folder, use the standalone
form on that repo:

```bash
gg one can commit
gg one do commit
```

## Push

```bash
gg do push
```

## Review

Let the user confirm that the review phase is started.

```bash
gg do review
```

gg creates pull requests for each repo and prints the URLs to the
terminal.

Afterwards load the review-light skill and execute it.

## Publish

- Create a blog post for the current ticket
- Update the index.jsonc and README.md
- Check `mergeMessage` and `versionIncrement` in `.gg/publish_config.json`
  of each repo — `gg do publish` offers them as defaults
- If the ticket was only planned, publish the project management repo only

Ask the user to run the following command **manually**:

```bash
gg do publish
```

gg triggers the pull request merge and publishes the changes to the
registry. Finally the version tag is created and pushed.
