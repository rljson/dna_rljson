# Create a gg workspace

## Create a dev dir

```bash
mkdir -p ~/dev2
cd ~/dev2
```

## Init a gg workspace

```bash
gg do init workspace
```

This creates the `.ocean` folder and instantiates the latest `dna_gg` in
the workspace folder: the gg guides, the skills and the managed block of
`CLAUDE.md`. It is the same as running `gg dna init`, `gg dna add dna_gg`
and `gg dna build` by hand.

## Add your repositories

```bash
gg do add dnaOrgUrl
```
